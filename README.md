Final Project for Drawing on the Web - Spring 2020

<ins>**Outline**</ins>

For my final project, I will be creating interactive drawings of the sky in three of its forms: 
- during daylight
- during sunrise/sunset
- during night time

I want to create an immersive interface in which the user can interact and relax to, because I’ve always personally found comfort in looking up at the sky. My goal is to recreate my own digital impression of that experience. 

For my daylight scene, I hope to include scenes mimicking that of floating clouds, flowers, and other animations of natural objects.

For my sunrise/sunset scene, I’d like to have an animation of the sun rising/setting, as well as include a body of water and potentially a lighthouse.

For my night scene, a goal of mine is to incorporate more user interactivity that can change the presentation of what's displayed - most likely through a bonfire, stars, and the moon.

For all of these scenes, the overarching visual theme that will tie the drawings together will be that each is built around an aesthetic of mixed media, giving the general feeling of a digital/interactive collage. I wanted this project to be both weird and interesting, and explore how objects could be interpreted into a different functional medium.
