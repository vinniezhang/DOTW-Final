Final Project for Drawing on the Web - Spring 2020

<ins>**Outline**</ins>

For my final project, I will be creating interactive drawings of the sky in three of its forms: 
- during daylight
- during sunrise/sunset
- during night time

I want to create an immersive and calming interface in which the user can de-stress to, and because I’ve always personally found comfort in looking up at passing clouds and stars, my goal is to recreate my own digital impression of that experience. 

For my daylight scene, the animations I hope to mimic are that of floating clouds, a flock of birds, and possibly additional flying objects (plane, leaves, balloons, etc).

For my sunrise/sunset scene, I’d like to have an animation of the sun rising/setting and also include clouds and a body of water, where users can cause ripples on its surface.

For my night scene, a big goal of mine is to incorporate constellations and have users interact with the stars in some sense as to be able to hover over certain groups of stars, and have the connecting lines of a constellation display. That would be the main focus of this drawing, but I may still include cursory cloud and moon (phases) animations.

For all scenes, I hope to layer instrumental audio as well, and the visual aesthetic will be that of mixed media, giving the overall feeling of a digital/interactive collage.
