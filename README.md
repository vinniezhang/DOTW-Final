# DOTW-final
Final Project for Drawing on the Web - Spring 2020

_Outline_

For my final project, I will be creating three interactive drawings of the sky three of its forms: 
- during daylight
- during sunset
- during night time

I want to create an immersive and calming interface in which the user can de-stress to, and because I’ve always personally found comfort in looking up at passing clouds and stars, my goal is to recreate a digital impression of that experience. 

For my daylight scene, the animations I hope to mimic include the floating of clouds, a flock of birds (potentially on user interaction), and possibly additional flying objects (plane, leaves, balloons, etc).

For my sunset scene, I’d like to have an animation of the sun slowly setting, and thus resulting in an overall color change. I would continue to include clouds and possibly also a body of water, where users can cause ripples on its surface.

For my night scene, a big goal of mine is to incorporate constellations and have users interact with the stars in some sense as to be able to hover over certain groups of stars, and have the connecting lines of a constellation display. That would be the main focus of this drawing, but I may still include cursory cloud and moon (phases) animations.

For all scenes, I hope to layer on instrumental audio as well.
